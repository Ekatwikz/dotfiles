# My dotfiles
```
yes | ./setup.sh
```

## Try with Docker
You can see the gist of how some of it looks from inside a container,  
not everythings works ofc tho  

### Alpine:
```
docker build -f./Alpine.Dockerfile -t ekatwikz/dotfiles:alpine-edge . && \                                                                                                               â”€
docker run -it ekatwikz/dotfiles:alpine-edge
```
